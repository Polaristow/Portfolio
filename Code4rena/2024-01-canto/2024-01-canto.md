## [H-01]  nextEpoch is incorrect

## Vulnerability details
### Impact
Rewards and voting weights are aligned on a weekly basis. However, nextEpoch is calculated incorrectly, which may break the invariant "The total rewards that are sent for one block should never be higher than the rewards that were configured for this block."
### Proof of Concept

Rewards and voting weights are aligned on a weekly basis. However, nextEpoch is calculated incorrectly, which may break the invariant "The total rewards that are sent for one block should never be higher than the rewards that were configured for this block."
```
Suppose BLOCK_EPOCH is 10, from block 30 to block 40 reward is 10 per block, from block 40 to block 50 reward is 1 per block. lastRewardBlock is 35, current block is 50. Then epoch will be 30, nextEpoch will be 45(should be 40) and blockDelta will be 10. Which means reward is calculated as 10 from block 35 to block 45. However, the real reward is only 1 from block 40 to block 45, which breaks the invariant.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
```
                uint256 nextEpoch = epoch + BLOCK_EPOCH;
```

```
            market.secRewardsPerShare += uint128((blockDelta * 1e18) / marketSupply); // TODO: Scaling
```
## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Do the Scaling.

```
                market.secRewardsPerShare += uint128((blockDelta * 1e18) / marketSupply); // TODO: Scaling
```
