|M-01 |PCLOCK_MODE() will not work properly for Arbitrum or Optimism due to block.number|

## [M-01]  CLOCK_MODE() will not work properly for Arbitrum or Optimism due to block.number

## Vulnerability details
### Impact
CLOCK_MODE will not work correctly on Arbitrum.


### Proof of Concept
According to Arbitrum (Docs)[https://developer.offchainlabs.com/time] block.number returns the most recently synced L1 block number. Once per minute the block number in the Sequencer is synced to the actual L1 block number.Using block.number as a clock can lead to inaccurate timing.

It also presents an issue for (Optimism)[https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/build/differences/#block-numbers-and-timestamps] because each transaction is it's own block.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Use block.timestamp rather than block.number
