## [M-01]  liquidateAccount will fail if transaction is not included in current block

## Vulnerability details
### Impact
Functon liquidateAccount will fail if the transaction is not included in current block because interest accures per block, and repayAmount and borrowBalance need to match precisely.
### Proof of Concept
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/8be784ed9752b80e6f1b8b781e2e6251748d0d7e/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L690-L693
At the end of function liquidateAccount, a check is performed to ensure that the borrowBalance is zero:
```
for (uint256 i; i < marketsCount; ++i) {
        (, uint256 borrowBalance, ) = _safeGetAccountSnapshot(borrowMarkets[i], borrower);
        require(borrowBalance == 0, "Nonzero borrow balance after liquidation");
}
```
This means that repayAmount specified in calldata must exactly match the borrowBalance. (If repayAmount is greater than borrowBalance, Comptroller.preLiquidateHook will revert with error TooMuchRepay.) However, the borrowBalance is updated every block due to interest accrual. The liquidator cannot be certain that their transaction will be included in the current block or in a future block. This uncertainty significantly increases the likelihood of liquidation failure.
## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Use a looser check
```
snapshot = _getCurrentLiquiditySnapshot(borrower, _getLiquidationThreshold);
require (snapshot.shortfall == 0);
```
to replace
```
for (uint256 i; i < marketsCount; ++i) {
        (, uint256 borrowBalance, ) = _safeGetAccountSnapshot(borrowMarkets[i], borrower);
        require(borrowBalance == 0, "Nonzero borrow balance after liquidation");
}
```

## [M-02]  _ensureMaxLoops causes liquidateAccount to fail in certain condition 

## Vulnerability details
### Impact
The function _ensureMaxLoops reverts if the iteration count exceeds the maxLoopsLimit. However, the limitation imposed by maxLoopsLimit hinders the functioning of liquidateAccount under certain conditions, as orderCount needs to reach twice the market count (which is also constrained by the maxLoopsLimit) in extreme cases.
### Proof of Concept
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/8be784ed9752b80e6f1b8b781e2e6251748d0d7e/contracts/Comptroller.sol#L667

Suppose maxLoopsLimit is set to 16 and currently 12 markets has been added, which is allowed by _ensureMaxLoops in function _addMarket:
```
allMarkets.push(VToken(vToken));
marketsCount = allMarkets.length;
_ensureMaxLoops(marketsCount);
```
Then, Alice enters all the 12 markets by depositing and borrowing simultaneously, which is also allowed by _ensureMaxLoops in function enterMarkets:
```
uint256 len = vTokens.length;
uint256 accountAssetsLen = accountAssets[msg.sender].length;
_ensureMaxLoops(accountAssetsLen + len);
```

To illustrate, assume these 12 coins are all stablecoin with an equal value. Let's call them USDA, USDB, USDC,..., USDL. Alice deposits 20 USDA, 1.1USDB, 1.1USDC,..., 1.1USDL, worth 32.1USD in total, then she borrows 2USDA, 2USDB, 2USDC,..., 2USDL, worth 24 USD in total. Unluckily, USDA depegs to 0.6USD, Alice's deposit value drop to 24.1USD, which is below the liquidation threshold (also below the minLiquidatableCollateral). However, nobody can liquidate Alice's account by calling liquidateAccount, because the least possible orderCount is 23, which exceeds maxLoopsLimit.

Let's take a closer look at LiquidationOrder:
```
struct LiquidationOrder {
       VToken vTokenCollateral;
       VToken vTokenBorrowed;
       uint256 repayAmount;
}
```
In this case, liquidator cannot perfectly match vTokenCollateral with vTokenBorrowed one-to-one. Because the value of collateral and debt is not equal, more than one order is needed to liquidate each asset. To generalize, if asset count is n, in the worst case, 2n-1 orders are needed for a complete liquidation (not hard to prove).
## Recommended Mitigation Steps
```
_ensureMaxLoops(ordersCount / 2);
```

## [M-03]  Market with zero supply can be exploited to drain the pool due to rounding error

## Vulnerability details
### Impact
When a new market is added with totalSupply equals to zero, Attacker can exploit a rounding error to drain the pool. This vulnerability has been used to attack Hundred Finance and influences all Compound v2 forks.
### Proof of Concept
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-venus/blob/8be784ed9752b80e6f1b8b781e2e6251748d0d7e/contracts/VToken.sol#L826-L842

In function redeemUnderlying,

```
redeemTokens = div_(redeemAmountIn, exchangeRate);
redeemAmount = redeemAmountIn;
```
Attacker donates to the pool to inflate exchangeRate (zero previous supply makes this easy), then redeemUnderlying is called, the calculated redeemTokens value is around 1.999 but rounded to 1. Thanks to this, Comptroller.preRedeemHook passes and attacker can sucessfully redeem the collateral (without repaying the debt first).

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
```
redeemTokens = div_(redeemAmountIn, exchangeRate) + 1;
```
