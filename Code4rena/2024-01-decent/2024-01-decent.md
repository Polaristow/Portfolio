## [H-01] setRouter lack access control
## Vulnerability details
### Impact
setRouter lack access control.
Anyone can set themselves as the router and pass through onlyRouter(). 
Can mint or burn tokens arbitrarily.
### Proof of Concept
https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DcntEth.sol#L20
```
 function setRouter(address _router) public {
        router = _router;
    }
```
## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Add onlyOwner modifier to setRouter.

## [H-02] GAS_FOR_RELAY is a hard-coded value
## Vulnerability details
### Impact
According to the LayerZero integration checklist:
https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/troubleshooting/layerzero-integration-checklist

LayerZero recommends a 200,000 amount of gas to be enough for most chains and is set as default.

In the DecentEthRouter, the GAS_FOR_RELAY is hardcoded at 100,000.
https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L96
```
uint256 GAS_FOR_RELAY = 100000;
        uint256 gasAmount = GAS_FOR_RELAY + _dstGasForCall;
```
Differences are summarized in the following article: https://docs.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/how-to-estimate-gas.
As an example even a simple approve transaction requires more than 100_000 gas on Arbitrum: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x04f97a39c6d03029518d1953226b343555ea585d2064a24a767155a548b0665e.

As this is hardcoded it will result with messages being sent to Arbitrum to always revert at the beginning of the lzReceive, and will result in blocked pathway between all chains and Arbitrum.
This can lead to failed messages on the destination. 

## [L-01] Potential DoS in collectFees.
Missing checks for address(0) issue can be found in automated findings, but here it could lead to a DoS, so two scenarios are described:

1. Owner hasn't set a signer, and the signer is defaulted to the zero address.
2. Owner sets the signer to the zero address.
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/src/UTBFeeCollector.sol#L18
```
    /**
     * @dev Sets the signer used for fee verification.
     * @param _signer The address of the signer.
     */
    function setSigner(address _signer) public onlyOwner {
        signer = _signer;
    }
```
This would fail to pass through splitSignature and render collectFees() unusable.

## [L-02] Do not hardcode useZero field to false

Do not hardcode useZro to false when estimating fees, pass it as a parameter instead. 

https://github.com/decentxyz/decent-bridge/blob/7f90fd4489551b69c20d11eeecb17a3f564afb18/src/DecentEthRouter.sol#L142
```
dcntEth.estimateSendAndCallFee(
                _dstChainId,
                destinationBridge,
                _amount,
                _payload,
                _dstGasForCall,
                false, // useZero
                adapterParams // Relayer adapter parameters
                // contains packet type (send and call in this case) and gasAmount
            );
```
See point 6 in this [integration checklist](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/troubleshooting/layerzero-integration-checklist) provided by the LayerZero team.

## [L-03] Use quoteLayerZeroFee to calculate the fee
Ensure that callBridge in StargateBridgeAdapter can execute as expected. 
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-decent/blob/main/src/bridge_adapters/StargateBridgeAdapter.sol#L170
```
    function callBridge(
        uint256 amt2Bridge,
        uint256 dstChainId,
        bytes memory bridgePayload,
        bytes calldata additionalArgs,
        address payable refund
    ) private {
        router.swap{value: msg.value}(
            getDstChainId(additionalArgs), //lzBridgeData._dstChainId, // send to LayerZero chainId
            getSrcPoolId(additionalArgs), //lzBridgeData._srcPoolId, // source pool id
            getDstPoolId(additionalArgs), //lzBridgeData._dstPoolId, // dst pool id
            refund, // refund adddress. extra gas (if any) is returned to this address
            amt2Bridge, // quantity to swap
            (amt2Bridge * (10000 - SG_FEE_BPS)) / 10000, // the min qty you would accept on the destination, fee is 6 bips
            getLzTxObj(additionalArgs), // additional gasLimit increase, airdrop, at address
            abi.encodePacked(getDestAdapter(dstChainId)),
            bridgePayload // bytes param, if you wish to send additional payload you can abi.encode() them here
        );
    }
```
Currently using msg.value in router.swap, to ensure that bridge() can be executed as expected. [Use quoteLayerZeroFee()](https://stargateprotocol.gitbook.io/stargate/developers/cross-chain-swap-fee) to get the fee required to call swap(). The fee ensures the cross chain message is paid for. Use it as the { value: xxxx } passed to the actual swap() method when you perform the swap.
