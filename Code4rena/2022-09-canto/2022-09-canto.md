## [H-01]  HARDCODED PRICES FOR STABLECOINS

## Vulnerability details
### Impact
Hardcoded prices of stablecosins may open some arbitrage opportunities and produce many bad loans in CLM.

Hardcoding price of cUSDT and cUSDC as 1 may open some arbitrage opportunities when real price for each token is a little bit different, and user can borrow more than it actual amount in Canto Lending Market . Also, in case of UST-style collapse, there are exist many bad loans in CLM.
## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Don't hardcode cUSDT Price to 1.


## [M-01]  LOSS OF PRECISION RESULTING IN WRONG LP TOKEN PRICE

## Vulnerability details
### Impact
when calculating token0TVL，it first divide the decimal and then multiplty reserve，it will cause loss of precision and will make LP token price wrong.
### Proof of Concept
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-canto/blob/65fbb8b9de22cf8f8f3d742b38b4be41ee35c468/src/Swap/BaseV1-periphery.sol#L581-L584
it calculate token0TVL use :

token0TVL = assetReserves[i] * (prices[i] / decimals)

It first divide the decimal and then multiplty reserve ,and it will result in a loss of price decimal.The result is token0TVL will be much less than the actual value, finally it will cause LPtoken price wrong.
## Recommended Mitigation Steps
please calculate like this:

token0TVL = assetReserves[i]  * prices[i] / decimals

## [M-02]  USE SAME SYMBOL CAN GET FAKED PRICE OF TOKEN 

## Vulnerability details
### Impact
it compare symbol to identify token，it can be exploit to produce fake price of token.

attacker can create a token which is like cToken and has symbol of cNOTE .When somebody call comptroller’s liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens ，it will give an unlisted token with other token(it can be unlisted token or listed token) collateral number.If there are other contracts without whitelist of token and use this price oracle, it will be exploit to produce faked price.
It produce a not official hardcode token's price is also a wrong logic.


## Recommended Mitigation Steps
use address instead of symbol to identify token
