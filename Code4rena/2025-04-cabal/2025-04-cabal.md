## [H-01] Timing-based inflation attack in LP staking

### Finding description and impact

`cabal.process_lp_stake()` computes how much LP token to mint with a ratio formula:

```rust
        // calculate mint cabal lp token amount
        let lp_amount = reward_amount + pool_router::get_real_total_stakes(m_store.stake_token_metadata[staking_type]);
        let cabal_lp_amount = option::extract(&mut fungible_asset::supply(m_store.cabal_stake_token_metadata[staking_type]));
        let mint_cabal_lp_amount = if (cabal_lp_amount == 0) {
            stake_amount
        } else {
            let ratio = bigdecimal::from_ratio_u64(stake_amount, lp_amount);
            (bigdecimal::mul_by_u128_truncate(ratio, cabal_lp_amount) as u64)
        };
        assert!(mint_cabal_lp_amount > 0, error::invalid_argument(EINVALID_STAKE_AMOUNT));
```

This code pattern is vulnerable to traditional inflation attack, but the assertion gives difficulty for attacker since he can't simply choose specific stake_amount that results in 0 minted LP token and repeat this process, therefore donating to the pool is hard.

However, there is a feature in the LP unstaking mechanism making inflation attack possible. Unstaking mechanism creates a time window where tokens can inflate the pool's accounting but have already been committed to a user:

```rust
// In process_lp_unstake() function:
m_store.staked_amounts[unstaking_type] = m_store.staked_amounts[unstaking_type] - unbonding_amount;
m_store.unstaked_pending_amounts[unstaking_type] = m_store.unstaked_pending_amounts[unstaking_type] + unbonding_amount;
```

1. When a user unstakes, tokens are moved to `unstaked_pending_amounts` but are not immediately undelegated
2. Actual undelegation only happens later when someone calls `batch_undelegate_pending_lps()`
3. Meanwhile, `process_lp_stake()` calculates shares based on `get_real_total_stakes()` which queries actual delegated tokens

See PoC section for an attack scenario.

### Recommended mitigation steps

There are a few possible fixes for this issue:

1. Implement atomic undelegation:
    - **Modify `initiate_unstake` to immediately call `pool_router::unlock()` rather than waiting for batch processing**
2. Modify share calculation:
    - **Calculate shares based on `lp_amount = pool_router::get_real_total_stakes() - m_store.unstaked_pending_amounts[staking_type]`**
    - **This would account for tokens that are delegated but already promised to other users**
3. Add a minimum liquidity requirement:
    - **Lock a portion of liquidity that can never be withdrawn (like Uniswap v2)**

### Proof of Concept

Here is a toy example of how this attack can be conducted:

1. Attacker makes the first deposit (1 token) to a new LP pool and receives 1 Cabal LP token
2. Attacker deposits a large amount (e.g., 9,999 tokens)
3. Attacker calls `initiate_unstake` to unstake the 1 Cabal LP token, creating an unbonding entry
4. Critical step: The LP tokens are subtracted from `staked_amounts` but still counted in `get_real_total_stakes` until `batch_undelegate_pending_lps()` is called
5. Victim deposits 10,000 tokens during this window and receives minimal Cabal LP tokens because:
    - **`get_real_total_stakes` shows ~20,000 tokens (original 10,000 + victim's 10,000)**
    - **But the Cabal LP supply is tiny (only what other users might have deposited)**
6. Attacker waits for `batch_undelegate_pending_lps()` to execute
7. Attacker claims their unbonded assets and victims' funds are permanently diluted
