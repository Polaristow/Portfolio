## [M-01]  First deposit can break share calculation

## Vulnerability details
### Impact
The first depositor of an ERC4626 vault can maliciously manipulate the share price by depositing the lowest possible amount (1 wei) of liquidity and then artificially inflating totalVaultCollateral.

share price can be maliciously inflated on the initial deposit, leading to the next depositor losing assets due to precision issues.


### Proof of Concept

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider requiring a minimal initial deposit amount in a vault.


## [L-01]  The minter can use past (already expired) times to mint rdpx bonds for users. 

## Vulnerability details
### Impact
In RdpxDecayingBonds.sol, in the mint() function, the minter can mint bonds for users without checking if expiry >= block.timestamp. This means the minter can use past (already expired) times to mint rdpx bonds for users.

However, when users call the bond() function in RdpxV2Core.sol to execute bonding, the _transfer function checks if expiry >= block.timestamp. Expired bonds won't pass this check, and users won't be able to transfer bonds that have expired.
### Proof of Concept
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/decaying-bonds/RdpxDecayingBonds.sol#L114
## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Add expiry >= block.timestamp in the mint() function as well.

## [L-02]  deprecated _setupRole

## Vulnerability details
### Impact
This function is deprecated in favor of {_grantRole}.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
use _grantRole instead

## [L-03] The deadline is set to a distant date

## Vulnerability details
### Impact
The deadline is set to a very large value when executing swap, causing the transaction to potentially linger in the mempool and execute at a much later time, which could result in worse prices for users.
### Proof of Concept
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/amo/UniV3LiquidityAmo.sol#L295
## Recommended Mitigation Steps
add appropriate deadline checks.


## [L-04] lack of expiration timestamp check

## Vulnerability details
### Impact
The transaction can be pending in mempool for a long time and can be executed in a long time after the user submit the transaction.
AMMs should provide their users with an option to limit the execution of their pending actions, such as swaps or adding and removing liquidity. The most common solution is to include a deadline timestamp as a parameter (for example see [Uniswap V2](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery/blob/0335e8f7e1bd1e8d8329fd300aea2ef2f36dd19f/contracts/UniswapV2Router02.sol#L229)).
### Proof of Concept

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
add deadline check
