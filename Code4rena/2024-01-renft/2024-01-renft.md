## [H-01]  attacker can match base, pay and payee order at the same time, as a result, escrow's accounting will be wrong and it can be drained

## Vulnerability details
### Impact
If the order is Base or Pay, ESCRW will increase the deposit.
```
// PAYEE orders are considered mirror-images of a PAY order. So, PAYEE orders
        // do not need to be processed in the same way that other order types do.
        if (
            payload.metadata.orderType.isBaseOrder() ||
            payload.metadata.orderType.isPayOrder()
        ) {
            /* .... */

            // Interaction: Update storage only if the order is a Base Order or Pay order.
            STORE.addRentals(orderHash, _convertToStatic(rentalAssetUpdates));

            // Interaction: Increase the deposit value on the payment escrow so
            // it knows how many tokens were sent to it.
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < items.length; ++i) {
                if (items[i].isERC20()) {
                    ESCRW.increaseDeposit(items[i].token, items[i].amount);
                }
            }
```
The way [Seaport matches orders](https://docs.opensea.io/reference/seaport-overview) is as follows:
Calling one of two "match" functions, matchOrders and matchAdvancedOrders, where a group of explicit orders are supplied alongside a group of fulfillments specifying which offer items to apply to which consideration itemsã€‚ Note that orders fulfilled in this manner do not have an explicit fulfiller; instead, Seaport will simply ensure coincidence of wants across each order.
Consider the following scenario:
|                | Base      | Pay            | Payee 1         | Payee 2          |
|----------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Offer items**| Nft A     | NFT B and 15 ERC20 | none            | none             |
| **Consideration items** | 10 ERC20  | none           | Nft A and 2 ERC20 | Nft B and 3 ERC20 |

The PAY order rented from the BASE order and corresponds with two PAYEE orders.
BASE order increases 10 in escrow.
Pay order increases 15 in escrow.
In this case, PAY only gives 15 to escrow.
The escrow's accounting will be incorrect.
This would cause a loss for the escrow, and in the worst-case scenario, it could lead to the escrow being completely depleted.

## [M-01]  A blacklisted renter can make the lender's NFT trapped in the safe.

## Vulnerability details
### Impact

In case of pay and payee order, lender pays the renter. if the the transfer fails, lenders cannot call stopOrders to retrieve their NFT.
There are two scenarios:

- When the payment token implements a blacklist, which is common for tokens on the Ethereum network (e.g. USDC/USDT implementing blacklist/blocklist; See: https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20).
The following steps describe this issue:
1. A blacklisted renter fulfills a PAY order. ERC20 token is transferred from lender to escrow successfully.
2. When the rent ended (or lender wants to stop the order before the end), In paymentEscrow, settlePayment() is used to settle all payments contained in the given item.
```
  function stopRent(RentalOrder calldata order) external {
        /* ...*/
        // Interaction: Transfer rentals from the renter back to lender.
        _reclaimRentedItems(order);
        // Interaction: Transfer ERC20 payments from the escrow contract to the respective recipients.
        ESCRW.settlePayment(order);
        /* ...*/
        // Emit rental order stopped.
        _emitRentalOrderStopped(order.seaportOrderHash, msg.sender);
    }
```
3. _safeTransfer fails, and the call will revert. the lender cannot stopRent and reclaim their item.
```
function _safeTransfer(address token, address to, uint256 value) internal {// Call transfer() on the token.(bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(
         abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transfer.selector, to, value));/.../
     if (!success || (data.length != 0 && !abi.decode(data, (bool)))) {
         revert Errors.PaymentEscrowModule_PaymentTransferFailed(token, to, value);}}
```
- In case of ERC20-compatible ERC777 token, similarly the renter can choose to reject the payment and lenders cannot call stopOrders to retrieve their NFT.
See https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc777 for details on ERC777 tokens.
The following steps describe this issue:
1. The lender uses ERC777 tokens, and the contract can accept/reject the transfer of tokens to it.
2. The lender can reject any transfer of tokens sent to it.
3. Due to the failed token transfer by the lender (ERC777 tokens invoke the tokensReceived function in the smart contract to complete the token transfer and revert), the lender is unable to receive the expected payment, also loss their NFT.
